# styleTransfer

`learnStyle` is an MATLAB script that performs gradient descent to learn an image style

## Before running:
* Download [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) and 
replace the path to `vl_setupnn` in `learnStyle.m` with your path
* Download the [vgg-face network](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face/) and place it in the folder's path. (git ignores this, as the file is large)
