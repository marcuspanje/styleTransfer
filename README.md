## Before running:
* Download [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/).
Create a file `setup.m` with the code `run(path/to/vl_setupnn);` 
* Download the [vgg-face network](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face/) and place it in the folder's path. (git ignores this, as the file is large)
